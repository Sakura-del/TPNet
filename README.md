# Explainable Reasoning on Temporal Knowledge Graphs by Pre-trained Language Model
This repository contains code and data for paper "Explainable Reasoning on Temporal Knowledge Graphs by Pre-trained Language Model". We propose a novel explainable reasoning approach for temporal knowledge graphs, namely TPNet, which sufficiently mines the structural information and logical semantics in TKGs.
